While grouping with `mesos.framework.name` on sysdig, it lists marathon from work running on one of the masters ( marathon [<ip>:8080] ). But the ip showing in the list might change when marathon is restarted. In that case we need to create alert for new listing name also. For solving this issue, we need to create alert for each of the master nodes. 
In order to do that:
- Go to Alerts page and select the alert we have created from above steps. Click copy for creating a similar alert. 
- Modify the master ip from the scope manually. 
- Specify the ip of another master and create a new alert. 
- Similarly create alert for each of the master nodes.
